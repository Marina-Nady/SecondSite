        <h2 class="title2">Mission</h2>
        <div  class="p1">    
        <p>The mission of Communities In Schools of Florida is to surround students with a community of support, empowering them to stay in school and achieve in life.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="p2">
        <p>CIS believes that every child needs and deserves each of the five CIS basics to help them succeed in school and in life:</p> 
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>A one-on-one relationship with a caring adult</li>
            <li>A healthy start and a healthy future</li>
            <li>A safe place to learn and grow</li>
            <li>A marketable skill to use upon graduation</li>
            <li>An opportunity to give back to community and peers</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>"Programs don't change children... relationships do."<br>—CIS Founder Bill Milliken</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="ques1">What is CIS?</h2>
        <div class="p3">    
        <p>CIS is a private, nonprofit organization that connects resources from public and private sectors with at-risk students. We utilize the    power of partnerships to serve students, schools and communities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="ques2">Why Does Florida Need CIS?</h2>
        <div class="p4">    
        <p>Too many young people are failing in our public schools today-and Florida has one of the highest dropout rates and lowest literacy rates in the nation. Schools alone cannot solve the complex and diverse problems faced by today's youth.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="ques3">Why Communities In Schools?</h2>
        <div class="p5">    
        <p>For more than 40 years, Communities In Schools has been America's largest, most successful dropout prevention program. In 2006, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a $9.9 Million grant to the CIS national network to expand services to students. Following extensive research on CIS, The Gates Foundation reported:</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p class="p6"> "The success of the CIS model rests on its ability to directly support at-risk students with community resources and services, balancing health, safety and social needs with academic demands. It is our responsibility to provide opportunities for students who clearly have so much potential. The effectiveness of the CIS school model sends a strong message that every student, no matter what their background and circumstance can learn and achieve at high levels."<br>—Jim Shelton Director of Education, The Gates Foundation</p> </div>
        <h2 class="ques4">How Does CIS Work?</h2>
        <div>
        <p class="p7"> CIS coordinates the delivery of existing community resources into the schools – right where they are needed. We also work to develop additional resources that will help meet the needs of each school site.</p> 
        </div>
        <h2 class="ques5">How do students benefit from CIS?</h2>
        <div>
        <p class="p8"> CIS has a proven track record of improving student outcomes in academic achievement and behavior patterns. Students participating in CIS projects have increased promotion and graduation rates, improved attendance, fewer discipline referrals and improved FCAT scores.</p> 
        </div>
        <h2 class="title">Proven Model</h2>
        <div>
        <p class="p9"> Today, many youth face personal, social, and academic pressures that, if not addressed, can lead them to become disengaged from school. Students struggle in school for a variety of reasons and will "drift out"–sometimes for years–before they "drop out." It is during this critical period that the proper supports and interventions–such as a caring adult, a safe place to be, academic tutoring, proper nutrition and health, and career exploration –can help students get back on track. At the same time, however, more of these youth than ever are experiencing a breakdown of family and community support systems. As a result, families are turning to schools as a community hub where these needs can be met, but schools are often under-resourced and struggling merely to address academics. CIS meets these needs by bridging the gap between schools and communities.</p> 
        </div> 
        <div>
        <p class="p10">Communities In Schools (CIS) was founded on the concept that students can and will achieve academically when resources to address their academic and social service needs are tailored, coordinated, and accessible. The cornerstone of the CIS model is a dedicated person at the school that coordinates the provision and integration of prevention services that are widely accessible to the entire school population, in conjunction with targeted interventions for those students most at risk of dropping out of school. The CIS Site Coordinator assesses each student's needs and then connects the student and his or her family with community-based educational and/or social services tailored to those needs. Whether students need tutoring, counseling, health services, career exploration, or mentors, CIS finds the resources and delivers them right inside the schools where young people spend their days, helping to ensure that the basic needs of our most at-risk children are met. The result is that teachers are free to teach, and students finally have the opportunity to focus on learning and success.</p>

        <div>
        <p class="p11">For 40 years, CIS has empowered students to stay in school, achieve, and prepare for life, resulting in increased graduation rates and improved life outcomes for millions of youth.</p>
